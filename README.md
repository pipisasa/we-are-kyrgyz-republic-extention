# We are not Kirgizstan. We are Kyrgyz Republic ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¬.

## Correcting the wrong country name ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¬

According to the Constitution of an independent and sovereign country, also written in Russian(!), the country is referred to as Kyrgyzstan or the Kyrgyz Republic. Therefore, calling Kyrgyzstan is wrong.

The creative agency BIRTOPS, together with a group of independent programmers, developed a special extension for a web browser that crosses out the incorrect name of the country - Kyrgyzstan - on the network, and replaces it with the correct one - Kyrgyzstan.

The goal is to unite the voices of caring Kyrgyzstanis and express their position on how their independent country is correctly called.
We call on all domestic media, businesses and all concerned citizens to join our demand.
